## ✅ What's Been Created

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ **Rust Project Setup** - Cargo.toml with all dependencies
- ✅ **Configuration System** - Cross-platform config management
- ✅ **IPC Communication** - Hachimi HTTP client
- ✅ **File Utilities** - Path handling, environment variables
- ✅ **Downloader** - Async HTTP downloads with progress
- ✅ **SQLite Manager** - Database connection and queries
- ✅ **Data Manager** - JSON file operations

### Documentation
- ✅ **README.md** - Project overview
- ✅ **MIGRATION.md** - Detailed migration plan
- ✅ **SUMMARY.md** - Summary of work done
- ✅ **COMPARISON.md** - VS Code vs Zed comparison

## 🎯 Purpose

This is an **experimental rewrite** of the ZokuZoku VS Code extension for Zed Editor. It demonstrates:
- How to port TypeScript/Node.js code to Rust
- The architecture differences between VS Code and Zed extensions
- A foundation for future Zed support

## 🔧 Key Features

### Implemented
- Configuration management with JSON storage
- Cross-platform path handling
- HTTP client for IPC communication
- Async file downloads
- SQLite database operations
- JSON serialization/deserialization

### Planned
- Python integration with PyO3
- Unity asset parsing
- UI components
- Tree views
- Custom editors

## 📊 Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Project Setup | ✅ Complete | Cargo.toml configured |
| Configuration | ✅ Complete | Full config system |
| IPC | ✅ Complete | HTTP client ready |
| Utilities | ✅ Complete | Path/file operations |
| Downloader | ✅ Complete | Async downloads |
| SQLite | ✅ Scaffold | Basic queries |
| Data Manager | ✅ Scaffold | JSON operations |
| Python Bridge | ❌ Pending | Needs PyO3 setup |
| Unity Assets | ❌ Pending | Needs UnityPy |
| UI Components | ❌ Pending | Needs Zed API |
| Tree Views | ❌ Pending | Needs Zed API |
| Custom Editors | ❌ Pending | Needs Zed API |

## 🚀 How to Use

### Build
```bash
cd ZedTest
cargo build --release
```

### Test
```bash
cargo test
```

### Run
```bash
cargo run
```

## 📝 Notes

1. **This is experimental** - Not production-ready
2. **Zed API needed** - Some features require Zed's extension API
3. **Python integration** - Needs PyO3 setup for UnityPy
4. **UI components** - Need to be rewritten for Zed

## 🔮 Future Work

1. Set up PyO3 and test Python integration
2. Implement Python bridge for UnityPy
3. Port Unity asset parsing logic
4. Wait for Zed UI API to mature
5. Implement UI components
6. Integrate with Zed's extension system

## 📚 Learn More

- See `README.md` for project overview
- See `MIGRATION.md` for detailed migration plan
- See `COMPARISON.md` for VS Code vs Zed comparison
- See `SUMMARY.md` for summary of work done

## ⚠️ Important

This is a **proof-of-concept** and **learning exercise**. The VS Code version should remain the primary supported version until:
- Zed's extension API matures
- All features are ported
- Performance is validated
- User testing is complete
